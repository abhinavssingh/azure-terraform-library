# YAML Deployment

I am using YAML basesd pipeline to deploy Terraform Resources in Azure. If you are unfamiliar with YAML pipeline then follow below urls to understand concepts of YAML.

1. [YAML Build Schema](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/yaml-schema/?view=azure-pipelines)
2. [Customize YAML Build Pipeline](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/customize-pipeline?view=azure-devops)

Here, I am also using template file for deployment. Through template file we can deploy into multiple environment without creating release pipeline.
